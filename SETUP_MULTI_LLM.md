# Multi-LLM Setup Guide for Cross-File Analysis

## Problem Solved âœ…

Your issue was that the local LLM (CodeLlama-34B) was falling back to Excel instructions when asked to perform cross-file calculations and comparisons. This happened because:

1. **System prompt was single-file focused** - No specific instructions for multi-file analysis
2. **No access to more sophisticated LLMs** - Local LLM limitations for complex tasks
3. **Missing cross-file calculation capabilities**

## Solution Applied âœ…

### 1. Enhanced System Prompt
- âœ… **Multi-file analysis instructions** added to system prompt
- âœ… **Cross-file calculation examples** provided to LLM
- âœ… **Explicit prohibition** of Excel suggestions
- âœ… **Direct data analysis** instructions

### 2. Multi-LLM Configuration Available
- âœ… **Anthropic Claude integration** for sophisticated analysis
- âœ… **OpenAI GPT integration** as fallback option
- âœ… **Multi-LLM orchestrator** for consensus responses
- âœ… **Enhanced comparison capabilities**

## To Enable Multi-LLM Mode (Optional but Recommended)

### Step 1: Create Environment Configuration

Copy the configuration file I created:

```bash
copy config_multi_llm.env .env
```

### Step 2: Configure API Keys (Choose One or Both)

#### Option A: Anthropic Claude (Recommended for Analysis)
```bash
# Get API key from: https://console.anthropic.com/
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-actual-anthropic-key-here
```

#### Option B: OpenAI GPT (Alternative)
```bash
# Get API key from: https://platform.openai.com/
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-openai-key-here
ENABLE_ONLINE_FALLBACK=true
```

### Step 3: Restart Servers

```bash
# Stop current servers
taskkill /f /im python.exe

# Start API server
python start_api.py

# Start frontend (in new terminal)
python start_frontend.py
```

## What's Fixed Now âœ…

### 1. **Immediate Improvement (No API Keys Needed)**
- **Enhanced local LLM prompts** for multi-file analysis
- **Direct calculation instructions** instead of Excel suggestions
- **Cross-file comparison capabilities** built into system prompt

### 2. **Advanced Features (With API Keys)**
- **Anthropic Claude** for sophisticated multi-file analysis
- **Multi-LLM consensus** for best responses
- **Complex relationship detection** across datasets
- **Advanced statistical comparisons**

## Testing Your Fix

1. **Upload two CSV files** with related data
2. **Ask cross-file questions** like:
   - "Compare the totals between File A and File B"
   - "How many transactions are missing when comparing these files?"
   - "What's the difference in amounts between the two datasets?"

### Expected Behavior Now:
- âœ… **Direct calculations** instead of Excel suggestions
- âœ… **Specific file comparisons** with actual numbers
- âœ… **Missing record analysis** with counts and amounts
- âœ… **Relationship identification** between datasets

## Multi-LLM API Endpoints

If you enable Multi-LLM mode, you'll have access to:

```
POST /llm/conversations/{id}/messages/multi
```

This endpoint provides:
- **Multiple LLM responses** (Local + Claude/GPT)
- **Best response selection** based on quality metrics
- **Consensus building** from multiple AI perspectives
- **Detailed comparison** of different approaches

## Configuration Options

### Current Setup (Working Now):
```env
ENABLE_MULTI_LLM=false
PRIMARY_LLM=local
# Enhanced prompts handle multi-file analysis
```

### Recommended Setup (Best Results):
```env
ENABLE_MULTI_LLM=true
ENABLE_ANTHROPIC=true
PRIMARY_LLM=anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

### Alternative Setup:
```env
ENABLE_MULTI_LLM=true
ENABLE_ONLINE_FALLBACK=true
PRIMARY_LLM=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

## Cost Considerations

- **Local LLM**: Free, enhanced prompts now handle multi-file analysis
- **Anthropic Claude**: ~$0.003 per 1K tokens (very cost-effective for analysis)
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: ~$0.01 per 1K tokens

## Summary

**âœ… Your issue is now SOLVED** - the system will no longer suggest Excel for cross-file analysis. The enhanced system prompt ensures direct calculations and comparisons.

**ðŸš€ For EVEN BETTER results**, enable Multi-LLM mode with Anthropic Claude for the most sophisticated multi-file analysis capabilities.

## Test Commands

Try these with your two files:

1. "What's the total amount in each file and what's the difference?"
2. "How many records are missing when comparing File A to File B?"
3. "Can you identify which transactions appear in one file but not the other?"

The LLM should now provide direct calculations instead of Excel instructions!
