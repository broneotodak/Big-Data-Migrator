## Overview

The Big Data Migrator's chat interface provides a sophisticated environment for having data-aware conversations with an LLM system. This allows you to:

- Discuss your data with an AI assistant that understands your datasets
- Explore data structure and relationships through natural conversation
- Generate visualizations and insights directly in the chat
- Save conversation context and decisions for migration planning
- Receive intelligent suggestions for data improvements

## Getting Started

1. Launch the Big Data Migrator application using the `start_frontend.py` script:
   ```
   python start_frontend.py
   ```

2. Navigate to the "Data Chat" or "Data Explorer" section using the sidebar.

3. Upload your data files in the "Upload & Process" section first, or select previously uploaded files.

4. Start a conversation by typing a message in the chat input field.

## Chat Interface Features

### Real-time Conversations
- **Context-Aware Responses**: The LLM understands your data context and can answer specific questions about your datasets.
- **Data Preview Integration**: View data previews directly in the chat when discussing specific datasets.
- **History Navigation**: Scroll through your conversation history and track the progression of your data exploration.

### Interacting with the Chat
- **Ask Data Questions**: "What's the distribution of values in the 'age' column?"
- **Request Visualizations**: "Show me a histogram of user registration dates"
- **Schema Information**: "What are the primary keys in this dataset?"
- **Relationship Queries**: "How does the users table relate to the orders table?"

## Data Exploration Features

The Data Explorer provides advanced capabilities for exploring your data:

### Data Structure Questioning
- Ask about column types, distributions, and statistics
- Explore relationships between datasets
- Identify potential data quality issues

### Interactive Visualization
- Generate charts and diagrams during conversation
- Customize visualizations with additional parameters
- Save visualizations for later reference

### Schema Analysis
- View database schema diagrams
- Receive suggestions for schema improvements
- Analyze table relationships

## Saving and Loading Conversations

### Saving Conversations
1. Click the "Save Conversation" button at the bottom of the chat interface.
2. Enter a title for your conversation.
3. Select which data files to include in the saved context.

### Loading Conversations
1. Navigate to the conversation history panel.
2. Select a saved conversation to resume.
3. All previous context and data references will be restored.

### Exporting Conversations
- Export as JSON for data portability
- Export as PDF for documentation
- Export as HTML for sharing

## Smart Suggestions

The chat interface includes a smart suggestion engine that provides:

### Contextual Suggestions
- Relevant questions to ask based on your current conversation
- Data exploration paths to consider
- Schema improvement recommendations

### Data Improvement Recommendations
- Data quality enhancement suggestions
